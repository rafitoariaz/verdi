##Methods
The survey was made in google forms and available to people on May 23 2019. It was distributed by telling friends and relatives to fill and distribute the survey via Whatsapp and by posting it in their facebook wall. The survey was also posted in facebook groups where people post their surveys so that they can fill it and in turn they fill others surveys (i.e. Student survey exchange 2019, Survey sharing 2019 (English, active only), Dissertation survey exchange, Survey exchange: find participants & respondents, Thesis/Survey Questionnaire Filling group).  
The sample is not random since people decided if they wanted to fill the survey, it was sent only by internet (where I would think most of the people who actively use internet are young) and it was asked to people that I know to fill it. However, it is a good first effort to know the feasibility of the offered package and travel characteristics of people that do ecotourism. 
 
 
##Do you like to do ecotourism in other countries?
Most of the people like to do ecotourism
```{r,echo=F,fig.align='center'}
#Know how many people have answered that they like ecotourism
 data.frame(table(survey$Like.ecotourism)) %>% 
  transmute(answer=Var1,
            counts=as.numeric(Freq)) %>% 
  mutate(prop=round(prop.table(counts),4)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(prop)) %>%
  mutate(lab.ypos = cumsum(prop) - 0.5*prop) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = prop, fill = answer)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", color = "grey") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0)+
  geom_text(aes(y = lab.ypos, label = paste(counts," (",prop*100,"%",")",sep="")), color = "black",fontface="bold") +
   theme_void() +
  labs(fill="Answer")#+
   #labs(title = "Do you like doing ecotourism?") #+
 #legend
```

```{r,echo=F,include=F}
#Are there specific countries that like or do not like ecotourism?
 survey %>% 
  group_by(Like.ecotourism,Country) %>% 
  summarise(counts=n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x =Country, y = counts)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  facet_wrap(~Like.ecotourism,ncol=1) +
  ylab("Counts") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90))
```

```{r,include=F}
#Add to the data base a column indicating its continent
 survey<-survey %>%
  filter(Country!="NA") %>% 
  mutate(Country=if_else(Country=="United States of America (USA)","United States",Country),
         Country=if_else(Country=="North Macedonia, Republic of","Macedonia,",Country)) %>% 
  inner_join(countrycode::codelist[,c("continent","country.name.en")] %>% select(Country=country.name.en,Continent=continent),by="Country") %>% 
  mutate(Continent=if_else(Country=="Mexico","Mexico",Continent),
         Continent=if_else(Country=="United States" | Country=="Canada","North America",Continent))
```

```{r,echo=F,include=F}
#Are there specific continents that like or do not like ecotourism?
survey %>%   
group_by(Like.ecotourism,Continent) %>%

  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  facet_wrap(~Like.ecotourism,ncol=1) +
  ylab("Counts") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90))
```
From now on, I will analyze the data considering only people that liked ecotourism
```{r,include=F}
survey2<-survey %>% 
  filter(Like.ecotourism=="Yes")
```

##Which countries and continents are represnted in the survey?
There were `r nrow(survey2)` people who answered the survey distributed in the following way:

* __Countries:__ The country with the highest representation was Canada, followed by the United States and Australia. 

* __Continents:__ All the continents are represented, although North America and Europe had the highest representation. NOTE: Mexico was considered as a separate factor in this analysis.
```{r,echo=F,fig.align="center"}

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)

rm(p1,p2)
```


##What is your gender?
There were more female than male respondents
```{r,echo=F,fig.align='center'}

  mutate(lab.ypos = cumsum(prop) - prop/1.5,
         lab.ypos=c(0.768,0.241,0.992)) %>% #Had to manually adjust values for putting the labels in the right position
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = prop, fill = answer)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", color = "grey") +

##What is your age?
Most of the respondents were between 21-35 years old, followed by people between 36-50 years

##Do you think that traveling to Mexico would involve finding the following situations? 
People are mostly worried about crime and corruption and, with a less extent, to food sanitary conditions and language communications 
```{r,echo=F,fig.align='center'}

##What do you expect to visit and know in an ecotouristic trip to Mexico?
People would like to know the local culture and natural parks in Mexico

```

##Would you pay $800 USD for a 6-day tourist package that would include eating authentic local food, visiting historical monuments, pyramids, museums, hiking in nature, accommodation, private transportation and a bilingual local guide?
Most of the people would buy the package that was offered to them
```{r,echo=F,fig.align='center'}
#Know how many people have answered that they woudl buy the package

```

##Conclusion
The results showed that most of the poeple that answered the survey like ecotourism and will be willing to buy the offered package. 
People from all the continents filled the survey, although there is a high representation of people from Europe and North America (excluding Mexico). People who answered the survey were single students and workers who were between 21 and 50 years old and had no children. Although people could travel during all year, people usually travel during December-January and May-August. It seems that people are very flexible for accomodation and food choices.People would like to know the local culture and do activities in natural parks.

The package we are offering to people seems to fulfill their expectatives , since we are offering them a good accomodation (2,3 and 5 stars hotels), hiking in natural parks and getting to know the local culture for a price that they would be willing to pay.
